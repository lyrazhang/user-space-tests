Before compiling the program, you must change the items below accroding to your environment:

- 'CROSS_COMPILE' in Makefile
- STM device name in stm_user_api.h
- TMC device name in stm_user_api.h


And then you may need to mount configfs manually:
/ # mount -t configfs none /config


Create policy directory for STM:
/ # mkdir /config/stp-policy/10006000.stm.abc

NOTE: 
The STM directory name consists of the device name to which it applies and the actual policy name,
separated by a dot.
The device name (say 10006000.stm) have to be matched the name of STM device under /dev.
The suffix is a random string without any dot


Create policy:
/ # mkdir /config/stp-policy/20100000.stm.abc/test
/ # echo 32768 65535 > /config/stp-policy/20100000.stm.abc/test/channels

'chan_start' (here is 32768) must be same with the corresponding value in example.c
